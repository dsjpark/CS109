<p>The practical motivation for our project comes from the rise of online commerce as the main method of acquiring goods and services. Amazon provides convenience and competitive prices, acting as a realistic alternative to traditional stores. Furthermore, Amazon offers an ever growing array of services from basic online shopping to web server hosting. Previous studies have shown that consumer reviews have an impact on sales, especially for niche products like video games (Zhu and Feng, 2010). For example, a product with a 5-star average tends to have better sales than a similar product with a lower rating.</p>
<p>Thus, in predicting the ratings from the text of these reviews, we want to determine whether the number of stars for a review is consistent with the corresponding textual sentiment. Is there inflation or deflation in ratings for certain products? Are the reviews independent and reliable in terms of the language used in them and the ratings given, or do they follow any trend based on date posted, a “follow-the-leader” type mentality? Are there differences in the ability to predict rating depending on the category of product being evaluated?</p>
<p>In being able to summarize the text review with a star rating, we can help people avoid reading overly long reviews and also cancel out any subjectivity that might be involved in giving a star rating.</p>
<p>Reports of partiality in amazon reviews have also been publicized This is especially true with book reviews, where it was discovered that some authors wrote reviews for their own books and wrote negative reviews for rival books (The Guardian). This leads to the question of what the distribution is of negative vs. positive reviews, and highlights the importance of exploring consumer reviews for biases and linkages. This information could help consumers reevaluate how much weight to put on consumer reviews when shopping on amazon. Furthermore, Amazon is the largest source of consumer reviews, and many consumers compare products that they plan to buy elsewhere with reviews on Amazon, so our findings could have applicability to online shopping in general (Business Wire).</p>

<p>If you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named <code>gh-pages</code> to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator written by our own Tom Preston-Werner. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.</p>
